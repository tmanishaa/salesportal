				<p>
					One of the most rewarding parts of my job is making an emotional
					connection with the wildlife I encounter. One of the most <em>challenging
					</em>aspects of my job is conveying that connection in a photograph. To
					do that, I have to make use of a very important compositional tool
					&#8211; perspective.<span id="more-19666"></span>
				</p>
				<p>For me, the starting point for photographing wildlife is
					choosing my viewpoint &#8211; where I stand or, more commonly,
					where I sit or lie. I position the camera to compose all the visual
					elements &#8211; the main subject, and foreground and background
					detail &#8211; in a particular way to reveal the story I want to
					tell.</p>
				<p>
					<img src="img/blog2.jpg" width="1145"/>
				</p>
				<p>If my story is focused on the animal or an aspect of its
					behaviour, I stand closer to give it visual weight. However, if my
					story is an environmental study of the animal in its habitat, I
					might stand further back to create a more balanced weighting.</p>
				<p>Often, I also find I’m shifting slightly to one side or
					another, changing the negative space (the area around the main
					subject) in order to eliminate a distracting object or highlight,
					or to create separation between overlapping objects.</p>
				<p>
					<img src="img/blog3.jpg" width="1145"/>
				</p>
				<p>One of the most important decisions I make is deciding on my
					eye level. Eye level influences the viewer in two ways. In relation
					to the horizon (implied or explicit) it determines the journey the
					viewer takes through the picture space. If I position the horizon
					low down, the eyes are forced to look upwards
					(foreground-to-background). I would do this, for example, when
					photographing animals in their environment where there’s a
					spectacular sky. If the sky is bland or I want to obscure
					background clutter, I shoot from a higher viewpoint, forcing the
					viewer to gaze from top to bottom.</p>
				<p>As well as determining the visual journey, eye-level also
					affects us psychologically because of a psycho-analytical theory
					known as the adult/child relationship. Adults gaze down at children
					and, in the adult/child relationship, are the dominant party.
					Children, being smaller, look up at adults making them the
					subservient participant. In an adult-to-adult or child-to-child
					relationship, where both parties are at the same eye level, neither
					is dominant nor submissive &#8211; the relationship is one of
					equality.</p>
				<p>
					<img src="img/blog4.jpg" width="1145"/>
				</p>
				<p>This psychology spills over into the relationship formed
					between the viewer and the principal subject in a photograph. With
					a low eye level, where the subject is looking down at the viewer,
					the subject is imbued with a sense of power, influence, authority
					or superiority, which creates an imposing, slightly daunting
					composition. The opposite applies when eye-level switches from low
					to high. With this composition, it’s the viewer who takes on the
					dominant role and the animal becomes more passive and meek. This is
					the reason I very rarely photograph wildlife from a high eye level.</p>
				<p>My favourite eye level is eye-to-eye. In this composition,
					the relationship between subject and viewer is equal. For wildlife,
					this is the most engaging angle because it helps to recreate the
					connection I make with my subjects, which is then passed on to the
					viewer.</p>
				<p>
					<img src="img/blog5.jpg" width="1145"/>
				</p>
				<p>
					Once I know my viewpoint, my attention switches to lenses. I should
					say upfront, although I’m a wildlife photographer, I’m a massive
					fan of short lenses. In fact, my favourite lens for wildlife
					photography is the equivalent of a 50mm standard lens and you’ll
					often find me with my <a
						href="index.html"
						target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>XF35mmF1.4</strong></a>
					prime lens attached to my <a href="index.html"
						target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FUJIFILM X-T2</strong>
					</a>or <a href="index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>X-H1</strong></a>
					bodies, or a <a
						href="index.html"
						target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>GF63mmF2.8</strong></a>
					prime on a<a href="index.html" target="_blank"
						rel="noopener"><strong> GFX 50S</strong></a>.
				</p>
				<p>The reason I like the “standard” lens is because it most
					closely replicates our own angle of view. In other words, the
					camera sees what we see and, because one of my main aims is to
					visually generate the human/animal connection, by getting close to
					revealing the situation as you would experience it with your own
					eyesight; I get closer to putting you in the moment, rather than
					making you a passive observer of it.</p>
				<p>
					<img src="img/blog6.jpg" width="1145"/>
				</p>
				<p>
					Of course, many times it’s impossible to get close enough to use
					such a short lens and so the lens I use most often on my main
					bodies (X-T2 and X-H1) is the <a
						href="index.html"
						target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>XF50-140mmF2.8</strong></a>
					short/medium telephoto zoom. As well as getting me visually closer,
					the telephoto aspect of this lens enables me to isolate the subject
					from the background, creating greater emphasis on the animal. Only
					when I need a much longer reach, if the animal is very distant,
					will I switch to the <a
						href="index.html"
						target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>XF100-400mmF4.5-5.6</strong></a>
					long telephoto.
				</p>
				<p>In life, perspective is how we see the world. In photography,
					perspective is how we present the world we see. In this sense, our
					point-of-view, the camera’s point-of-view and the lenses we choose
					are all intrinsically linked.</p>
